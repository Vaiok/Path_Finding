		This is the help text with instructions for how to use this program.
  		It can be toggled on and off with the 'Help' button.
  		The 'Clear Graph' button will clear all nodes and edges, resetting the graph.
		The 'Find Path' button searches for a path from the start to the goal.
		If there is no node marked as start or goal, 'Find Path' will do nothing.
		Under 'Canvas Click Mode' are 5 radio buttons.
		These buttons change how clicking on the canvas affects it.
		'Create Nodes' adds a blue node to the canvas if you click on it.
		This node represents a location.
		New nodes that would overlap existing nodes are not created.
		'Create Edges' adds a red edge between two nodes if you click on them both.
		This edge represents a path between 2 locations.
		Nodes can't have edges to themselves or multiple edges with the same node.
		'Delete Items' deletes nodes and edges if you click on them.
		Deleting a node automatically deletes all edges connected to it.
		'Select Start' marks a node as the start of a path.
		'Select Goal' marks a node as the goal of a path.
		No more than one start node and one goal node are allowed at a time.
		All mouse clicks are with the main button(left), other buttons do nothing.
